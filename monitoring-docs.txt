When it comes to trailing stop losses, we keep a trailing position that follows price

Every minute we check the current point in price and compare it to the previous saved point a minute ago

The previous point in price is in the table `tradeMonitoring`
    SELECT * FROM tradeMonitoring WHERE idAssociatedTrade=@idAssociatedTrade

When we see that the current point in price is higher than the previous price a minute ago, we simply update the
table with the new data and leave it at that

If the current price is lower than the higher point, we check the distance between the previous higher point and the current
point in price

If the distance between those points is larger than our trailing stop loss, we skim some profits. This is when the trailing
stop loss is considered hit like so:

    const distanceFromTrailingSL = monitoringData.highestProfitPercentage - item.unrealizedProfitPercentage

Then we take some profits like so:

    const responseSell = await sellToken(item.address, settings.percentageToTakeAtTrailingStopLoss, false) // Take some off

This is assuming that we have the "lockInProfits" disabled meaning price didn't do a 2x for a risk free trade
if we have "lockInProfits" the bot will wait until the price does a 2x meaning you duplicated your investment

At that point, the program will sell half of your position and keep the rest for a risk free trade. Then, the trailing
stop loss is activated and we monitor it with those 2 points like described before
